	<h1>Falon Beere</h1>
	<h1>Bio &amp; Resume</h1>

<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>y name is Falon Beere, I am a junior and a VCD major at Eastern Washington University. I grew up in a small town in South Central Washington called Goldendale, I have two older sisters and a single dad. In seventh grade I started to get really into drawing and I self-taught myself how to draw for five years, in the middle of the fifth year I was really close to getting into the ESD Art Show for the top ten high school art students. Around the fourth year, I started to really dislike drawing and I usually prefer to write instead.  I plan on going into advertising when I graduate and I love to learn about everything. Iâ€™m usually very quiet until I get used to someone, and I hate being around groups of people. I have slight dyslexia along with dyscalculia, which is math dyslexia, despite that I really love to write and read and I find math to be interesting with the right teacher.</p>
